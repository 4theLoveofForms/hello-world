me doing some learnins

Hi I am George.  I am really interested in ways of colleborating on lots of different versions in a neat and easy to do way.

This Git Hub seems to have the communication bits you need just when you ned them. 

Lets explain some stuff about Taxing squrils.

==thoughts about how git hub works==
Its nice in Git Hub how you can see the changes that are preposed. 

I wonder whether people would contrebute to someone elces branch befor mixing it in with the master?

Exciting just seen some part about your profile page.
